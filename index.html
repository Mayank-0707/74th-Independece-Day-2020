   <p>
    Independence Day is annually celebrated on 15 August, as a national holiday in India commemorating the nation's
    independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act
    1947, as passed by the United Kingdom Parliament, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent
    Assembly came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to full republican and
    Constitution of India 1950 replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India with the enactment of the sovereign law
    Constitution of India. India attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent
    resistance and civil disobedience.

    Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which the British India was divided along religious lines into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation.
    The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan.

    Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago
    However, the earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE. At the site of Mehrgarh, Balochistan, Pakistan, presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.
    By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more widely,and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilization flourished between 2,500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India and was noted for its urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.
</p>
<p>In the early second millennium BCE, persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to villages. Around the same time, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from regions further northwest in several waves of migration. The resulting Vedic period was marked by the composition of the Vedas, large collections of hymns of these tribes whose postulated religious culture, through synthesis with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, gave rise to Hinduism. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose later during this period. Towards the end of this period, around 600 BCE, after the pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of which they deforested to pave way for agriculture, a second urbanisation took place. The small Indo-Aryan chieftaincies, or janapadas, were consolidated into larger states, or mahajanapadas. The urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new ascetic movements in Greater Magadha, including Jainism and Buddhism, which opposed the growing influence of Brahmanism and the primacy of rituals, presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion, and gave rise to new religious concepts.

<h4>Why we celebrate Independence Day ?</h4>

<p>Answer:This day is celebrated to sort of remember the sacrifice and courage of the people who granted us this independence and by virtue of whom we are a democratic and free country now in most aspect. It also stands as a solidarity event between the different people in all walks of life residing in the vast country of India. </p>
